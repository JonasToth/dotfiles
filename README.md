# My Dotfiles

This repository contains my dotfiles that I use on various machines.
Inspired by many dotfiles other people use, r/unixporn and so on.

## Installation

Using [GNU stow](https://alexpearce.me/2016/02/managing-dotfiles-with-stow/).

```bash
$ git clone ...
$ cd dotfiles
$ stow nvim tmux
```
